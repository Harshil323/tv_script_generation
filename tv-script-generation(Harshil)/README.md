# Generate TV Scripts
It is a project for autogenrated tv script using data of Seinfield_scripts which is in the filder called data/Seinfield_scripts.txt

I have used pytorch as a library and used Recurrent Neural Network. LSTM(Long-Short Term Memory) is used for automated tv script with supervised learning  tv scripts automatically genated.
